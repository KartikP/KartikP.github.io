I recently read a post on /r/datascience that raised the question: `why so many people with PhDs think that's an easy pass for data science?`

Initially, I found this question rather puzzling. The notion of a "PhD", and as an "easy pass" is contradictory. Obtaining a PhD is anything but easy; it  often constitutes the most formidable intellectual challenge a person has to rise up to in their lifetime. Perhaps that is one source of confusion. So for now, I will attempt to describe `what does a PhD really require` and I will be focusing on a STEM degree (although I believe this can be applied to some non-STEM programs).

A PhD is also known as a Doctorate in Philosophy degree. In most fields, it is the highest academic degree a person can achieve. It typically is the result of several years of research and study in a very narrow and technical domain of knowledge. It culminates as a substantial novel contribution to scientific knowledge (e.g., increasing understanding, developing new technologies, shifting paradigms, etc.)

**Over the course of a PhD program, students will undertake a rigorous journey that requires them to:**
1. Consume thousands of pages of knowledge in their field,
2. Identify gaps in the current understanding,
3. Generate well-constructed hypotheses,
4. Design carefully thought out experiments to test hypotheses,
5. Perform (often technical and cutting-edge) experiments,
6. Collect data (often from a variety of sources and tools),
7. Conduct extensive analysis of the data,
8. Formulate scientific interpretations of the results, 
9. Publish the findings in reputable peer-reviewed journals, 
10. Present their findings to other academics,
10. And repeat this until they've met their degree requirements. 

All this is generally done with a certain level of autonomy that is alien to the structured coursework of undergraduate and master's programs. 

**Throughout their journey as a PhD student, they will encounter numerous challenges:**
1. Experiments will fail, 
2. Inter-personal conflicts between supervisors, lab members, collaborators (or their animal model ðŸ¤£) will develop, 
3. Manuscripts will get rejected,
4. Projects will hit dead-ends, 
5. They will feel like quitting.

Yet some how, they must overcome all this and succeed. 

Then, at the end of their degree, they will compile all their findings into a 200-page(ish) thesis that will be sent to experts in their field. They hope they get the *opportunity* to stand in front of them and defend every decision they made over the last X years. Of the course of a 2 hour defense, you will look like you haven't slept in 2 days. Jokes aside, I guarantee you that every STEM PhD holder has gone through this. A PhD is grueling, frustrating, anything but easy, yet often rewarding in retrospect (see [type 2 fun](https://www.rei.com/blog/climb/fun-scale))

Hopefully you can understand that a PhD is not something you should be willing to do unless you truly enjoy the pursuit of knowledge. 

As to `what makes people with PhDs more adept at data science right out of school?`, I will address that question in a separate post.
