About me
======
**Computational neuroscientist** transitioning into a [full stack data scientist](https://shopify.engineering/what-is-a-full-stack-data-scientist) whilst pursuing a few ventures spinning out of my doctoral work. 

I completed a Bachelor of Science with an Honours Double Major in Genetics and Physiology at Western University with an emphasis on neurophysiology. 

I recently completed my **doctorate in Neuroscience** at [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca) supported by the [NSERC PGS-D scholarship](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp). My research investigated the development of microcircuits in neuronal networks using [multielectrode arrays](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8868577/) through collaborations with The Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, CA) and The Salk Institute for Biological Studies (San Diego, US). Specifically, I looked at how *MECP2* mutations (that cause Rett Syndrome) produce dysfunctional network circuitry in monolayer cultures (2D cell cultures). More recently, I investigated a potentially early functional biomarker of Alzheimer's disease in astrocyte-enriched cerebral organoids (3D cell cultures). I am an expert in in vitro multielectrode array disease modelling with a focus on electrophysiological analysis.

Outside of my research, I have been involved in [pro-bono management consulting](https://www.universityconsultinggroup.com) for non-profit organizations in both the US and Canada.
