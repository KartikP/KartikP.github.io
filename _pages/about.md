About me
======
**Computational neuroscientist** transitioning into a [full stack data scientist](https://shopify.engineering/what-is-a-full-stack-data-scientist) whilst pursuing a few ventures spinning out of my doctoral work. 

I completed a Bachelor of Science with an Honours Double Major in Genetics and Physiology at Western University with an emphasis on neurophysiology. 

Currently a **Neuroscience doctoral candidate** at [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca) supported by the [NSERC PGS-D scholarship](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp). My research investigates the early circuit development of neuronal networks using [multielectrode arrays](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8868577/). Specifically, I am looking at how *MECP2* mutations (that cause Rett Syndrome) produce abberant network circuitry in monolayer cultures. Recently, I've begun investigating a potentially early functional biomarker of Alzheimer's disease in astrocyte-enriched cerebral organoids. I am an expert in in vitro multielectrode array disease modelling with a focus on electrophysiological analysis.

Outside of my research, I have been involved in [pro-bono management consulting](https://www.universityconsultinggroup.com) for non-profit organizations in both the US and Canada.
