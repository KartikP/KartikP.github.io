About me
======
**Computational neuroscientist** transitioning into a [full stack data scientist](https://shopify.engineering/what-is-a-full-stack-data-scientist) whilst pursuing a few ventures spinning out of my doctoral work.

As a scientist, I am dedicated to understanding the complexities of constructing the human system through a bottom-up approach from genetics, developmental biology and organogenesis, to neuroscience. I am interested in taking this knowledge to build better human-like artificial systems.

I completed a Bachelor of Science with an Honours Double Major in Genetics and Physiology at Western University with an emphasis on neurophysiology. 

I recently completed my **doctorate in Neuroscience** at [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca) supported by the [NSERC PGS-D scholarship](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp). My research investigated the development of microcircuits in stem cell-derived neuronal networks using [multielectrode arrays](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8868577/) through collaborations with The Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, CA) and The Salk Institute for Biological Studies (San Diego, US).

Outside of my research, I have been involved in [pro-bono management consulting](https://www.universityconsultinggroup.com) for non-profit organizations in both the US and Canada.
