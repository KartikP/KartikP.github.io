Currently wrapping up my PhD @ Western University.

About me
======
Computational neuroscientist transitioning into data science. 5+ years of experience in designing experiments, handling complex datasets, developing analysis pipelines, and implementing statistical/machine learning models. My experience in leading cross- functional collaborations and communicating technical findings equips me to work seamlessly in interdisciplinary teams. My background in management consulting for non-profit organizations demonstrates my capacity to apply data-driven solutions to real-world challenges.

Professional experience
======
Completed a Bachelor of Science with an Honours Double Major in Genetics and Physiology at Western University with an emphasis on Neurophysiology.

Currently a **Computational Neuroscience doctoral student** at Western University. My research investigates the developmental trajectory of neuronal networks using  multielectrode arrays. Specifically, I am looking at how MECP2 mutations (that cause Rett Syndrome) produce abberant network circuitry in monolayer cultures as well as how Alzheimer's disease presents itself in astrocyte-enriched cerebral organoids.

Outside of my research, I have been involved in pro-bono **management consulting** for non-profit organizations in both the US and Canada.
