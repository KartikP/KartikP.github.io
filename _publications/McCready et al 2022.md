excerpt: 'Multielectrode array technology allows researchers to record the spontaneous firing activity of cultured neurons over a period of multiple weeks or months. These data can be valuable for understanding how the functional relationships between neurons evolve as they begin to form connections and wire into a functional network. This technology has been adopted by researchers using stem cells to produce human neurons in culture to study neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the dizzying complexity and scale of the data generated have posed some challenges with the analysis and interpretation of experimental results. Here, we first provide historical context as to why multielectrode array platforms were originally developed, and use this perspective to explore some of the challenges currently facing the field. We then highlight new analysis methods, provide some guidance for improving the analysis of multielectrode array data, and discuss standardizing how these findings are communicated in scientific publications.'
