title: "Distinct neural codes in primate hippocampus and lateral prefrontal cortex during associative learning in virtual environments"
collection: publications
permalink: Corrigan et al 2022
excerpt: 'The hippocampus (HPC) and the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) are two cortical areas of the primate brain deemed essential to cognition. Here, we hypothesized that the codes mediating neuronal communication in the HPC and LPFC microcircuits have distinctively evolved to serve plasticity and memory function at different spatiotemporal scales. We used a virtual reality task in which animals selected one of the two targets in the arms of the maze, according to a learned context-color rule. Our results show that during associative learning, HPC principal cells concentrate spikes in bursts, enabling temporal summation and fast synaptic plasticity in small populations of neurons and ultimately facilitating rapid encoding of associative memories. On the other hand, layer II/III LPFC pyramidal cells fire spikes more sparsely distributed over time. The latter would facilitate broadcasting of signals loaded in short-term memory across neuronal populations without necessarily triggering fast synaptic plasticity.'
